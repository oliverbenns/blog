# 2019

Working on some WebGL lately. Working on quick whiteboard project, hoping to get more of the basics down - that means without any dependencies. It'll allow you to draw in different colours and sizes, as well as drag the whiteboard around to clear and shift your current work to draw more. Project is merely for educational purposes.

It can be found here: [https://github.com/oliverbenns/webgl-whiteboard](https://github.com/oliverbenns/webgl-whiteboard).

After this project and with more time spent on trigonometry, I want to learn more game programming. I plan on using an engine, most likely Godot at this time as it's open source, is solid for 2d work and I don't have to use their proprietary language GDScript as they now support C# and C++.
