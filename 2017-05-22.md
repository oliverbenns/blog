# The Npm Install Culture

> There's a npm package for that.

Oh man this gets tiring. Especially when the packages are < 100 lines. Are web devs forgetting how to program? Check out the whole shit storm of the `left-pad` npm package being removed last year - that package was 11 lines of code:

```
module.exports = leftpad;

function leftpad (str, len, ch) {
  str = String(str);
  var i = -1;
  if (!ch && ch !== 0) ch = ' ';
  len = len - str.length;
  while (++i < len) {
    str = ch + str;
  }
  return str;
}
```
