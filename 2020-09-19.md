# Vim Cheatsheet

Vim is an editor with a steep learning curve. This is a list of shortcuts that I have learnt and use regularly. It is by no means intended to be a comprehensive list and will continue to grow as I learn more.

## Navigation

- `h/j/k/l` - left, down, up, right
- `:Ex` - enter netrw
- `gg` - to start of file
- `G` - to end of file
- `0` - to start of line
- `$` - to end of line
- `b` - to beginning of word
- `w` - to beginning of next word
- `ctrl-n` - go down in list, turns out this works on various other software e.g. Chrome + Sublime autocomplete
- `ctrl-p` - go down in list, turns out this works on various other software like Chrome + Sublime autocomplete
- `:ls` - list all listed buffers
- `:bn` - next buffer
- `:bd` - delete buffer
- `:b` - switch to certain buffer, can tab for autocompletion, can search too. Or use a number from `:ls`.
- `ctrl-d` - move down half a screen
- `ctrl-u` - move up half a screen
- `vib` - select in brackets (much more ergonomic than `vi(`)
- `dib` - delete in brackets (much more ergonomic than `di(`)
- `HML` - high, middle, low, move cursor to this position of the screen to prevent hitting `kkkkkkkk`.

## Windows

- `ctrl-w s` - split horizontally.
- `ctrl-w v` - split vertically.
- `ctrl-w w` - toggle between
- `ctrl-w r` - switch windows around (left <-> right)
- `ctrl-w =` - Normalize all split sizes 
- `:Vex` - visual split create a new vertical window in netrw mode `:Vex!` adds to RHS

## Searching
- `/` - to search. My vimrc settings allow for case-insenstive unless a capital letter is used
- `*` - on a current word to use that as the search term
- `N/n` - Go back and forward between the matches.

## Editing

- `u` - undo
- `ctrl-r` - redo
- `p` - paste
- `y` - yank (copy)

## Selecting

- `V` - select by whole lines
- `v` - select text
- `ctrl v` - visual block, when wanting to operate on multiple lines at once (adding tabs, commenting out etc)

## Vim Go

- `gd` - Go to definition
- `ctrl t` - Go back a defintion (pop the 'go to' off the stack)

## FZF

- `:FZF` - search for file. Select a file in the list to open in new buffer

- [Graphical cheat sheet](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif) - 2006 so dated but looks comprehensive and is often referenced.
- [Devhints cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/vim) - this website has a bunch of great software engineering cheatsheets and cuts throught the rubbish.

## Settings

You may find my .vimrc settings file here: [https://github.com/oliverbenns/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc](https://github.com/oliverbenns/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

Plugins are installed in the setup script of that dotfiles repository.
