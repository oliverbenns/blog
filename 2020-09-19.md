# Vim Cheatsheet

Vim is an editor with a steep learning curve. This is a list of shortcuts that I have learnt and use regularly. It is by no means intended to be a comprehensive list and will continue to grow as I learn more.

## Navigation

- `hjkl` - left, down, up, right
- `:vs` - visual split create a new vertical window
- `:Vex` - visual split create a new vertical window in netrw mode
- `:Ex` - enter netrw
- `ctrl + w + w` - toggle between windows
- `gg` - to start of file
- `G` - to end of file
- `0` - to start of line
- `$` - to end of line
- `b` - to beginning of word
- `w` - to beginning of next word
- `ctrl n` - go down in list, turns out this works on various other software e.g. Chrome + Sublime autocomplete
- `ctrl p` - go down in list, turns out this works on various other software like Chrome + Sublime autocomplete
- `:ls` - list all listed buffers
- `:bn` - next buffer
- `:bd` - delete buffer
- `:b` - switch to certain buffer, can tab for autocompletion, can search too. Or use a number from `:ls`.
- `ctrl d` - move down half a screen
- `ctrl u` - move up half a screen

Plugins are installed in the setup script of that dotfiles repository.
