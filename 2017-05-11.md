# Domain Checker

Wrote a quick Python 3 script to check for domain name availability. Been wanting to write this script for awhile and thought I'd try a different language. I saw Python was doing pretty well in popularity in the [Stack Overflow 2017 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology), so figured I'd give that a shot since I hadn't tried it since Python 2.5 or something.

Basically it's not bullet proof and I'm sure there's a ton of problems with it, but for 3-4 hours work, it's enough for my needs and it was a decent enough learning experience.

Also, although I didn't end up needing any dependencies for a tiny script, I had a brief look for Python's version of the npm `package.json`. I found out they still use the 2.x package manager `pip`, but everything is installed globally and the only way to save the dependencies for others to know is through a plain text file. Check out [this Stack Overflow answer for more info](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13537901/python-equivalent-of-npm-or-rubygems).

Like `pip install -r requirements.txt`? Seriously? What's up with that?

You can check out the repo here: [https://github.com/oliverbenns/domain-checker](https://github.com/oliverbenns/domain-checker). I would have thought this would be a pretty mainstream tool but that doesn't seem to be the case. Might be a good SaaS model idea there somewhere.
