# Phaser Starter

Based on my last 2 game jams, I've put together a little starter project for those to get up and running with Phaser with ease. It's running Webpack, transpiling ES6, has automatic page reloading and can publish to Github pages. The maker of Phaser retweeted my tweet about it so it's had a few people look at it.
