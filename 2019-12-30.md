# Spotification - Mp3 to Spotify Migration

Like many using the internet in the 2000's, I've accumulated a rather large mp3 track collection. I wanted to add them to Spotify so I could archive them, this is different to _playing_ local mp3 files through the client which is what appears in most search results on this subject.

I wanted to find the Spotify tracks because:

- It allows the tracks to be accessible on all devices
- Clears up my hard disk space
- Gives the ability to share tracks and playlists
- Have all the album artwork and meta data all set and good in the client

It also appears playing local files is quite a hidden feature so I wouldn't be surprised if support for this is eventually dropped.

As I couldn't find a tool to do this, I created a basic Go script to do this automatically for me using the Spotify api: [https://github.com/oliverbenns/spotification](https://github.com/oliverbenns/spotification). Feel free to use it yourself, but bear in mind it's very much tailored to my file naming conventions at the time but it should be an easy adjustment to parse other conventions.
