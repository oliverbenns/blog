# Dieter Rams' Good Design Principles

Whilst I'm currently in Berlin, I checked out the [Braun Design Collection](http://www.braundesignsammlung.de/). A private collection of Braun products on display to admire. I love Rams' belief in "Less, but Better". Here are his 10 design principles, that he believes still hold true today:

- Good design is innovative.
- Good design must be useful.
- Good design is aesthetic design.
- Good design makes a product understandable.
- Good design is honest.
- Good design is unobtrusive.
- Good design is long-lasting.
- Good design is consistent in every detail.
- Good design is environmentally friendly.
- Good design is as little design as possible.
