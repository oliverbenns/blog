# CGA Game Jam Entry

My entry for the 2017 GGA Game Jam is now live on [itch.io](https://oliverbenns.itch.io/cga-ricochet). Overall I learnt a lot about the Phaser game engine and how it is all put together. The game could have been better in my opinion, but time didn't allow. Regardless, it was still a positive experience for me. I see the game as a starter prototype that could be the beginning of something larger. Custom target rotation, obstacles, timing-orientated firing etc.

- Built with [Phaser 2.6.2](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
- SFX by [LittleRobotSoundFactory](https://www.freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/packs/16681/)
- This game is open source. The repository is here: [https://github.com/oliverbenns/cga-jam](https://github.com/oliverbenns/cga-jam)
