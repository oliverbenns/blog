# UK Housing Developments

I built an open source app that maps locations of housing developments from some of the biggest UK developers.

I recently learnt about Coattail investing (aka copycat investing) from Rob Dix at [Property Hub](https://propertyhub.net). He states that housing developers do incredible amounts of research to find areas to invest in, and far more than you could yourself as an individual. Knowing this and that their investment choices are likely sound, you could mimic their strategies to your advantage\*.

The problem I found was that there wasn't a great way to get a birds eye view of these developments from multiple companies. So, I built this app to solve that by displaying a map of developments from [Barratt](https://www.barratthomes.co.uk/), [Bellway](https://www.bellway.co.uk/), [Berkeley](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/), [Persimmon](https://www.persimmonhomes.com/) and [Taylor Wimpey](https://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/).
