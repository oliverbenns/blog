# General Assembly 1 Month In - Rails!

I've been picking up some Ruby on Rails as that's what General Assembly is using so I thought it best I start doing some homework. Rails follows the convention over configuration paradigm extremely closely, naming variables certains ways makes them constants, view file names must match controller file names and folder structure is strict. It's my first experience with this, and it feels very ...restrictive truthfully, but perhaps it's just because I'm not used to it. With that said, the decisions seem sound and are based on a typical MVC structure.

I've also recently been reading The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. I'm not very far through at this stage, but it's brimming with stories and metaphors that tie back to the art of programming. It's been recommended to be several times before, so it's about time I dive in.
