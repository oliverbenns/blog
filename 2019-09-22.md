# Farewell, General Assembly

After a lot of consideration, I have decided that my position at GA no longer fits where I want to be and therefore my last day will be October 4th.

I worked on the Platform team for the majority of my time and have learnt a heck of a lot due to being in the fortunate position of having some very smart team members.

My main highlights are:

- Working as one of two developers working on GA's student facing application where users can access their coursework, take assessments, access various learning resources and have awards issued to them. This project has been my main focus and has seen a complete design and code overhaul over a multitude of iterations. The app is now 100% strictly typed using Typescript, something I am very, very fond of.
- Built and launched GA's React UI framework that has been adopted by several GA applications to keep brand consistency, reduce code duplication and speed up development by allowing developers to focus on business logic and less on pixel pushing.
- Add various features to GA's existing admin panel that allows the authoring of learning materials as well as manage users and assign learning resources to them.

I am suffering from severe burnout. One might expect me to go into causes at this point, but I don't think it's particularly professional to start shining your previous employer in a negative light, so I shan't.

I'm lucky enough to be able to quit my job without needing another gig already lined up. For this reason I am making the most of it and taking some time out to do some travelling and some self learning. Where that will be is to be decided very shortly.

I have got a growing list of things I'd like to learn and know more about, all mostly programming related. I am going to check these off and work on some of my own projects.

Around the turn of the year I will be looking for a new position in software engineering. If you are interested, please reach out.
