# Joy Theme Creator

I recently played around with [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview), the new UI library by the MUI team, but less Google-esque and opinionated.

The library is still in alpha stage but it's looking very promising.

Inspired by a [theme creator for MUI](https://bareynol.github.io/mui-theme-creator), I created a web app that exposes the theme customisation options available. It does this by providing colour and typography picker controls that gives a live preview and theme config options you can copy into your own project. Check it out here: [https://oliverbenns.github.io/joy-theme-creator](https://oliverbenns.github.io/joy-theme-creator).
