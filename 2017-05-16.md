# React Native Beginnings

After creating a quick Node api, I've been playing around with React Native to prototype an idea I've had for some time. My thinking was by using it I could get native performance (it's not a web app),target both iOS and Android with ease and building views would be nice and familiar to me.

Well, any initial set up with React is at least twice as hard in React Native. With all these libraries and dependencies, I sometimes feel like I'm just patching things together rather than programming, which is actually kind of depressing given that in X years it'll all be old hat. Hmm...
