# Agile is Dead

Found a great talk by David Thomas (co-author of The Pragmatic Programmer) on how the word 'Agile' has become a noun and consequently, is now used as a buzz word to sell.

He states it's time to reclaim agility by following 3 simple steps:

- Find out where you are
- Take a small step towards your goal
- Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
- Repeat

It's really quite simple, and what the agile manifesto for software development's core values are, regardless of epics, story points and the rest of the bulk that comes with the word 'agile' today.

## Don't let people tell you what to do!

> All rules Are universal. All rules need context.

Agile is not what you do. Agility is how you do it.
