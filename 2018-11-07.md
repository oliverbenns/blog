# Blog updates

Recommited everything in a new format. Removed the `sen` Bash tool I previously wrote as it wasn't really doing much for me than just giving nice commit messages.

Made everything super simple now: all markdown files in the root directory, file name is merely a date, whereas previously it also allowed a title. No README, no bash files, just Markdown, that's all it's ever needed to be.

Keep it simple, stupid.
