# WhatsApp ChatGPT

I built a service to connect WhatsApp to ChatGPT. The idea was that I wanted ChatGPT on the go without paying for a third party phone app. Furthermore I wanted experiment with the Twilio and OpenAI apis.

I added the ability to install to Google Cloud Run and Digital Ocean with ease by adding their 1-click install buttons to the documentation.
