# Hello World

First post!

I found that blogging was always time consuming because of all the things you have to edit in a CMS in order to just publish a message. Title, url, cover post, meta, formatting, cms maintenance, plugin updates, databases, servers blah blah blah.

After reading the book "Masters of Doom", I was quite inspired by the staff at id software (creators of Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake amongst others). The company used `.plan` Unix files to document day-to-day activity so that keen gamers knew what was going on in their next anticipated release. These `.plan` files were basically plain text and not usually much longer than a couple paragraphs or few bullet points. I created an archive of John Carmack's files [here](https://github.com/oliverbenns/john-carmack-plan).

Based on that simplicity, I built a quick minimal blogging platform called [Sen](https://github.com/oliverbenns/sen) that creates posts in the form of Markdown files and pushes them up to a Git repo. I built it with Bash, which was surprisingly tough - there are so many constraints with the language and cross-platform issues. It was all made for the purposes of this blog. So if needs change here or I find issues, I'll update the project accordingly. I'm already wondering how I go about handling images.

The main purpose of this blog is to document my development career. I might also document others areas of life such as my current pursuit as a digital nomad, but I haven't decided on that one yet. Let's see how it goes!
