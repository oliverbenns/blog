# Deep Work

I've just finished reading Deep Work by Cal Newport. Here's some notes.

## What?

Deep work is performing professional work in a completely distraction free state that allows for deeper cognitive capabilities which allow us to provider more quality and quantity to something we are learning or trying to contribute to.

## Why?

Because the 2 abilities required to thrive in today's economy are:

- The ability to quickly master hard things
- The ability to produce at a elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

## How?

- Learn to train your mind to not give in to distractions.
- Take time away from screens.
- Quit social media if it provides no value. They are designed to keep your attention.
- Schedule your day into block so you have ample time for deep work as well as shallow work.
